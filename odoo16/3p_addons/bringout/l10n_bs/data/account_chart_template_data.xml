<!--
        Many countries use this accounting type for managing their accounting operations. 
        In anglo- saxon accounting, the costs of sold products are reported only after they are sold/delivered 
        to the respective customer. But, the costs of the products will be taken into account as soon as 
        they are received in stock of the company in Continental accounting.

        The expense account will not be affected even if you receive a product or create a bill 
        in Anglo- Saxon accounting. It will be affected only after the product is invoiced to the final customer. 
        Create a purchase order for a product (set the inventory valuation of the product as Automated to automatically 
        record the accounting entries).
